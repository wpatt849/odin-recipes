    <h1>French Toast</h1>
    <img src="images/french_toast.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thick slices of bread, soaked in a mixture of beaten eggs with milk and cinnamon, toasted in a frying pan, and served with butter and maple syrup. Best if you work with thick slices of French or Italian loaf bread that are several days old.
        That way they've had a chance to firm up, which will make the slices hold up better when you dip them in the egg milk mixture and fry them.
Thin slices of fresh bread tend to fall apart or get mushy when you do this, making for lousy French toast.  </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 eggs</li>
                <li>3/4 cups milk</li>
                <li>3 tbl brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>12 slices brioche bread</li>
                <li>1 tbl ground cinnamon</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Add the milk, brown sugar and nutmeg; stir well to combine.</li>
                <li>Soak bread slices in the egg mixture until saturated.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Brown slices on both sides, sprinkle with cinnamon and serve hot.</li>
