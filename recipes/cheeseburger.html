    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound 85% lean ground beef </li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated sweet onion (from 1 small onion) </li>
                <li>2 tablespoons roasted, peeled, and chopped Hatch chiles (from fresh or thawed frozen chiles) </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt </li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper </li>
                <li>1/4 cup canola oil, divided </li>
                <li>8 white American cheese slices </li>
                <li>4 brioche hamburger buns, split </li>
                <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted </li>
                <li>6 tablespoons mayonnaise </li>
                <li>6 tablespoons Hatch Chile Salsa</li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Using your hands, combine beef, onion, chiles, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl just until evenly incorporated. Shape into 8 (2 1/2-ounce) balls.</li>
                <li>Heat a large cast-iron skillet or griddle over high until smoking. 
                    Add 2 tablespoons oil. Add 4 meatballs, and immediately flatten to 1/4-inch-thickness with a sturdy, wide spatula. 
                    Cook until bottoms are crisp and deep brown, about 1 minute. 
                    Flip patties, top each with 1 cheese slice, and cook until bottoms are well charred and cheese is melted, 
                    45 seconds to 1 minute. Remove from skillet, and cover to keep warm. 
                    Repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil, remaining 4 meatballs, and remaining 4 cheese slices.</li>
                <li>Preheat broiler to high with oven rack 5 to 6 inches from heat. 
                    Brush cut sides of buns with butter. 
                    Arrange buns, cut side up, on a baking sheet. 
                    Broil in preheated oven until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes. 
                    Spread each bottom bun half with 1 1/2 tablespoons mayonnaise, top with 2 patties, and spoon 1 1/2 tablespoons Hatch chile salsa over top. 
                    Cover with top bun halves, and serve immediately.</li>
                
            </ol>
